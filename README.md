## Internationalization (i18n)

The application is designed to be easily translatable.

### UI Text Translations

*   All UI text elements (labels, button texts, titles) are stored in a nested dictionary named `translations` within `turnpicker.py`.
*   The structure is `translations[language_code][key] = "Translated Text"`.
    *   Example: `translations['es']['app_title'] = "Selector de Turnos"`
*   To add or modify translations:
    1.  Identify the language code (e.g., `'fr'` for French).
    2.  Find the appropriate key for the UI element (e.g., `'name_selector_title'`).
    3.  Add or update the entry in the `translations` dictionary.

### Card Game Rules Translations

*   Card game rules are stored in a separate nested dictionary named `card_game_rules_translations`.
*   The structure is `card_game_rules_translations[language_code][game_name] = "Translated Rules Text"`.
    *   Example: `card_game_rules_translations['fr']['Poker'] = "RÃ¨gles du Poker..."`
*   To add or update rule translations:
    1.  Ensure the `game_name` matches exactly with the names in `card_games_list`.
    2.  Add the translated rules under the appropriate language code and game name.
    3.  The application will automatically pick up these translations when the language or game selection changes. If a translation is missing for the current language, it defaults to English rules.

## Code Structure (Brief)

*   **Main Script:** `turnpicker.py` contains all the application logic, UI definitions, and translation data.
*   **GUI:** Built using the Tkinter library (`tk` and `ttk` modules).
*   **Core Data Structures for i18n:**
    *   `translations`: For general UI text.
    *   `card_game_rules_translations`: For card game rules.
*   **Functions:**
    *   `update_ui_language()`: Handles dynamic updating of all display text when the language is changed.
    *   Separate functions `show_name_selector_frame()`, `show_dice_roller_frame()`, `show_dnd_helper_frame()`, `show_card_game_frame()` manage the display of different screens.
    *   `show_card_game_rules()`: Updates the rules display in the Card Game Helper based on selection and language.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are some ways you can help:

*   **Add More Card Games:**
    1.  Add the game name to the `card_games_list` in `turnpicker.py`.
    2.  Add the rules for the new game (in English) to `card_game_rules_translations['en']`.
*   **Translate Card Game Rules:** Provide translations for existing or new card game rules in the `card_game_rules_translations` dictionary for various languages.
*   **Translate UI Text:** Add or improve translations in the `translations` dictionary for any of the supported (or new) languages.
